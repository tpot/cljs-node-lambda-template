# cljs-node-lambda

A Leiningen template for executing AWS Lambda functions in ClojureScript.

## Usage

Run `lein new cljs-node-lambda foo` to create a template project that
will display a test message and exit successfully.

Use the `run` target in the template `Makefile` to execute the Lambda
function inside a Docker container from the excellent
[lambci/docker-lambda](https://github.com/lambci/docker-lambda)
project. This allows you to test the function locally without having
to package and deploy the code to AWS. The AWS credentials environment
variables triplet are passed through to the container to allow the
function to make AWS API calls.
